# list comprehensions

# list comprehensions are used for creating a new list from existing iterables like tupels, strings, arrays list etc.

# a  list comprehension is made of
# 1. an expresion,
# 2. for element in old list
# 3. if condition

# a list comprehension has more time and space efficiency than loops   , it has fewer lines of code, it transforms iterative statement into a formula

s_names = [x + ' staff member' for x in names if 'S' in x]
